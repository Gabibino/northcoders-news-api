## Setting Up Environment Variables

Since the `.env.*` files are ignored by Git, you will need to create two environment variable files locally:

1. Create a `.env.development` file with the following content:
   
 PGDATABASE=nc_news_dev

   

2. Create a `.env.test` file with the following content:
   
  PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
